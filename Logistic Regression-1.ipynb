    "Ans - The cost function used in logistic regression is called the log loss or cross-entropy loss. It quantifies the error between predicted probabilities and actual binary outcomes (0 or 1). The goal is to minimize this cost function, which means finding the model parameters that make the predicted probabilities as close as possible to the true labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The log loss function is optimized using an iterative algorithm called gradient descent.  In each iteration, the algorithm calculates the gradient of the cost function with respect to the model parameters. The gradient indicates the direction of steepest ascent, so the algorithm updates the parameters in the opposite direction (direction of steepest descent) to reduce the cost. The size of the update is controlled by a learning rate hyperparameter. This process is repeated until the cost function converges to a minimum or a stopping criterion is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "The log loss function is well-suited for logistic regression because it is convex, meaning it has a single global minimum. This ensures that gradient descent will converge to the optimal solution, given enough iterations and an appropriate learning rate."

    "Ans - Regularization in logistic regression is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the cost function. This penalty discourages the model from assigning excessively large weights to the features, which can lead to capturing noise in the training data and poor generalization to new data. It essentially introduces a bias towards simpler models, promoting a balance between fitting the training data well and avoiding overly complex models.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The most common types of regularization used in logistic regression are L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization. L1 regularization adds a penalty proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients, while L2 regularization adds a penalty proportional to the square of the coefficients. Both penalties encourage the model to keep the coefficients small, but L1 regularization has the additional effect of driving some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection.   \n",
    "\n",
    "By controlling the strength of the penalty (through a hyperparameter), regularization helps to reduce the model's complexity and prevent it from memorizing the training data too closely. This leads to a model that is more likely to generalize well to new, unseen data, improving its predictive performance on real-world scenarios."

    "Ans - The ROC curve, or Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, is a graphical representation of a binary classifier's performance across varying classification thresholds. It plots the True Positive Rate (TPR) against the False Positive Rate (FPR) at different cutoff points for classifying instances as positive or negative. In the context of logistic regression, the threshold determines the probability above which an instance is classified as positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ROC curve helps evaluate a logistic regression model by visualizing its ability to distinguish between the two classes. A good model has a curve that hugs the top-left corner, indicating high TPR and low FPR across various thresholds. The Area Under the Curve (AUC), a summary metric derived from the ROC curve, quantifies the model's overall performance. An AUC of 1 represents a perfect classifier, while an AUC of 0.5 indicates a random classifier. A higher AUC generally signifies a better model."
